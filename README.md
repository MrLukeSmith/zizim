# Zizim URL Shortener

Zizim is a URL shortener, written in PHP. This code hasn't been optimised, it's mainly been tidied up from the original codebase which I wrote a few years ago. 

The general purpose of this code, is to generate a shortened URL. You parse in a URL (and optionally an alias) and it provides you with a _shortened_ version. Similar to bit.ly and tinyurl. 

The script captures basic click information, however this data isn't being utilised as of yet.

I've re-written Zizim using OOP principles, the new code is in a new repository named _Zizim OOP_, [visible here](https://github.com/smithmr8/zizim-oop).
